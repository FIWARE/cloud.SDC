    Scenario Outline: Install a new product release

      Given a configuration management with "<cm_tool>"
      And a created product with name "${CONFIG_FILE}" and release "${CONFIG_FILE}"
      And a virtual machine with these parameters:
	  | fqn            | hostname        | ip              |
	  | ${CONFIG_FILE} | ${CONFIG_FILE}  | ${CONFIG_FILE}  |
      When I install the product in the VM
      Then the task is created
      And the task is performed
      And the product installation status is "INSTALLED"
      And the product is installed

      Examples:

      | cm_tool |
      | chef    |
      | puppet  |


    Scenario Outline: Install a new product with different releases

      Given a configuration management with "<cm_tool>"
      And a created product with name "<product_name>" and release "<product_version>"
      And a virtual machine with these parameters:

	  | ${CONFIG_FILE} | ${CONFIG_FILE}  | ${CONFIG_FILE}  |
      When I install the product in the VM
      Then the task is created
      And the task is performed
      And the product installation status is "INSTALLED"
      And the product is installed

      Examples:

      | product_name              | product_version | cm_tool |
      | qa-test-product-chef-01   | 1.2.3           | chef    |
      | qa-test-product-chef-01   | 1.2.4           | chef    |
      | qa-test-product-puppet-01 | 1.2.3           | puppet  |
