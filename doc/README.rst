FIWARE SDC Manager - Overview
______________________________


What you get
============

The FIWARE Software Deployment and Configuration (SDC) GE is the key enabler
used to support automated deployment (installation and configuration) of software
on running virtual machines. As part of the complete process of deployment of applications,
the aim of SDC GE is to deploy software product instances upon request of the
using the SDC API or through the Cloud Portal, which in turn uses the PaaS Manager GE (see `FIWARE PaaS Manager`_).

After that, users will be able to deploy artifacts, that are part of the application,
on top of the deployed product instances.
